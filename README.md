# Unhandled JSON Key Access in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when working with JSON data: accessing a key that does not exist in a JSON object.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that throws an exception because it tries to access a key that might be missing from the JSON response. The `bugSolution.dart` file shows how to handle this situation gracefully.
